# Accordion ReadMe

This an accessible accordion. If the javaScript isn't implemented, everything is visible.

## JavaScript
**Utilizes jQuery**

The set-up for this component creates a span element by each h3 element, it contains a hint that this is an accordion. The script then hides each element that is intended to fold out.

The execution is one function. Our accordion is displayed with an animation, the hint is hidden, and the accordion toggle is given the class *selected* &mdash; which is styled differently.
