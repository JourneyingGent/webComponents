# Accessible Web Components

This is a collection of accessible web components! They are all pretty basic and include..

- Only necessary HTML
- CSS for the non-javaScript &amp; scripted versions
- JavaScript using the jQuery library(CDN coded into HTML)

Feel free to check this out and let me know what you think. I'd be happy to see how others approach these components!
